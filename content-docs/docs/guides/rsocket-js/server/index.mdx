`rsocket-js` implements the 1.0 version of the [RSocket protocol](./protocol)
and is designed for use in Node.js and browsers.

## Status

The following are currently implemented:

- RSocketClient / RSocketServer
- Node.js TCP/WebSocket server/client transport
- Browser WebSocket client (binary)
- TCK client for spec compliance testing
- UTF-8 and Binary encoding at the transport layer
- Optional JSON (de)serialization at the rsocket layer (send and receive objects
  instead of strings)
- ReactiveStream data types

## Reactive Streams

rsocket-js includes an implementation of the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
API in JavaScript. Note that unlike standard Rx Observables, Reactive Streams are
_lazy_, _pull-based_, and support _back-pressure_. Two types are implemented:

- `Flowable`: An implementation of the Reactive Streams `Publisher` type,
  providing a demand-driven stream of values over time.
- `Single`: Like `Flowable`, but resolves to a single value.

rsocket-js public API methods typically return values of these types.
